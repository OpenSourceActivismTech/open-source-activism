				<h2 class="major">Why Open Source?</h2>
				<p>For too long, advocacy tools have been fragmented and siloed. Campaigns and consultants control the code, acting as gatekeepers to innovation and locking up data in proprietary systems.</p>
				<p>We think technology should be owned by the movement. Progressives believe we can do more together than we can individually, and that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. The technology we build and use should reflect the values we advocate.</p>

				<p>We are looking for developers, designers, user experience advocates, and allied organizations and campaigns to build open tools that push the field forward and are available to all. We have three current tools, and have plans for many more.</p>
