## Interactive chatbots for activism 

We built [HelloVote](https://hello.vote) with Fight for the Future in 2016, and helped over 160,000 Americans register and get ready to vote with a 65% completion rate. We are now extending that experience to develop customized chat platforms including SMS, Facebook Messenger, Twitter, Telegram, and other conversational interfaces.

Utilizing the [RapidPro framework](https://rapidpro.github.io/rapidpro/), developed with UNICEF Innovation and currently supported by [Nyaruka](https://nyaruka.com), we aim to show that open source collaboration can lead to better products than siloed development. We will extend the existing codebase by providing connectors to common activism CRMs, and adding common flows for new organizations to get started quickly. We are currently testing event checkin and rating interactions, and are designing viral messenger experiences for rapid campaign growth.
