Using knowledge learned in the 2016 Democratic primaries and by Avaaz in the 2017 European elections, we have designed a simple interface for volunteers to contact mobile and landline phones. Connecting enthusiastic callers from progressive areas with registered voters in swing districts across the country will enable campaigns to scale out and break the filter bubble. Our open source code is extensible, translatable, and cheaper to scale than existing vendor solutions.
